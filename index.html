      <h1 class='copy-header'>Intro</h1>
	  <p class='copy-body'>While unpaid leave may be available to all, paid parental leave is uncommon in the United States A benefit left up to the employer, paid leave is not required by law and, according to PL+US: Paid Leave for the United States, is unavailable to 114 million Americans. Unpaid leave provides job security and extends employee benefits, but many cannot afford to take time off to care for the families. The Atlantic pointed out in 2013 that nearly half of those who qualified for leave, but did not take it, said it was due to financial reasons.</p>
	  <p class='copy-body'>In 2018, more private companies than ever are updating their policies to reflect the current workforce and job climate, offering paid  parental leave for both salaried employees and hourly workers. Below we look at the ten largest employers in the United States and their parental leave policies, user-reported on FairyGodBoss.com. From Walmart to UPS, these companies employ more than 5.7 million people and all reportedly offer some form of maternal leave, paid or unpaid. When it comes to new fathers, however, leave is limited and users report no paternal leave at four of the ten.</p>

	  <p class='copy-body'>We looked at crowdsourced data on parental leave policies at more than 1700 workplaces across the country (via FairyGodBoss). This data is presented below and shows a staggering variance in length of parental leave, for both mothers and fathers -- the longest paid leave reaching 52 weeks for either sex (what up Netlfix and Bill Gates?) while a majority of workplaces offer between six and twelve weeks. Meanwhile,  230 companies reportedly offer no paid maternal leave at all, and 120 offer no paid leave for new fathers (while 1193 don’t report anything at all).</p>
	  <p class='copy-body'>The difference in maternal and paternal leave is also stark, both in number of reports (1557 vs 535, respectively) and in average leave length (8 weeks paid/8.8 weeks unpaid for mothers vs 4½ weeks paid/8 weeks unpaid for fathers). See for yourself below, using the filters to show paid or unpaid, sort by industry, or find a specific company.</p>

      <h1 class='copy-header'>U.S. vs the World</h1>
	  <p class='copy-body'>We also looked at how the United States compares to rest of the world in terms of federal parental leave policies. As mentioned previously, the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 requires workplaces to offer at least 12 weeks of unpaid parental leave. There is no requirement, however, to offer paid leave. Compared to all 38 developed countries, as defined by the United Nations, the United States ranks last in length of federally mandated paid maternity leave length. In fact, the US is the only country to offer no paid maternal leave whatsoever. In comparison, six countries, including Sweden and the United Kingdom, offer 52 weeks or more for new mothers. The US is one of 11 countries to offer zero weeks paid paternity leave.</p>
