      <h1 class='copy-header'>A Brief History of Parental Leave in the United States</h1>
	  <p class='copy-body'>During his first term as President, Bill Clinton passed the Family and Medical Leave Act, providing 12 weeks of federally-mandated unpaid leave to new parents. The bill aimed to addressed a major shift in the American workplace -- the percentage of working mothers with children under 18 jumped from 35 percent in 1965 to 67 percent in 1992.</p>
	  <div class='pL-quote-container'><div class='pL-quote'>“I believe that this legislation is a response to a compelling need—the need of the American family for flexibility in the workplace. American workers will no longer have to choose between the job they need and the family they love.” - Bill Clinton, 1993</div></div>
	  <p class='copy-body'>Since then, the need for flexibility has only grown, with more and more parents having full-time jobs. Yet federal policies haven’t changed. Obama was an advocate of paid family leave, but never succeeded in getting legislation across the finish line. Some American cities and states have even agreed to provide paid leave to their residents, but these initiatives still fall short. Paid leave remains unavailable to 114 million workers in the United States, and nearly half of the population who qualify for unpaid leave are unable to take it due to financial reasons. </p>
	  <p class='copy-body'>As a result, the burden has fallen on the private sector to draw up their own individual policies. Recently, large companies have responded to the call. Based on user-reported data from FairyGodBoss.com, we’ve mapped out the family leave policies offered by America’s ten biggest employers to serve as a snapshot for what the U.S. has to offer. Amazon and IBM, the two largest tech employers, lead the way with 20 weeks of paid maternity leave. Berkshire Hathaway falls on the other side of the spectrum at just five weeks, the shortest amount among America’s 10 largest companies. Paternity leave numbers were missing for four of the ten companies shown, but in general tend to be much less generous.</p>

      <h1 class='copy-header'>Company Policies</h1>
	  <p class='copy-body'>We looked at crowdsourced data on parental leave policies at more than 1700 workplaces across the country (via FairyGodBoss). This data is presented below and shows a staggering variance in length of parental leave, for both mothers and fathers -- the longest paid leave reaching 52 weeks for either sex (what up Netlfix and Bill Gates?) while a majority of workplaces offer between six and twelve weeks. Meanwhile,  230 companies reportedly offer no paid maternal leave at all, and 120 offer no paid leave for new fathers (while 1193 don’t report anything at all).</p>
	  <p class='copy-body'>The difference in maternal and paternal leave is also stark, both in number of reports (1557 vs 535, respectively) and in average leave length (8 weeks paid/8.8 weeks unpaid for mothers vs 4½ weeks paid/8 weeks unpaid for fathers). See for yourself below, using the filters to show paid or unpaid, sort by industry, or find a specific company.</p>

      <h1 class='copy-header'>U.S. vs The World</h1>
	  <p class='copy-body'>We also looked at how the United States compares to rest of the world in terms of federal parental leave policies. As mentioned previously, the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 requires workplaces to offer at least 12 weeks of unpaid parental leave. There is no requirement, however, to offer paid leave. Compared to all 38 developed countries, as defined by the United Nations, the United States ranks last in length of federally mandated paid maternity leave length. In fact, the US is the only country to offer no paid maternal leave whatsoever. In comparison, six countries, including Sweden and the United Kingdom, offer 52 weeks or more for new mothers. The US is one of 11 countries to offer zero weeks paid paternity leave.</p>
